# Learning Hub

A central hub for learning Python, Data, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence through practical 
examples and projects.

This repository is personally maintained by me, a Mechanical Engineer (M.Sc.), with a background in 
optimization and the development of mathematical solvers for the oil and gas industry, and a 
postgraduate degree in Artificial Intelligence and Optimization (BI Master – PUC-Rio).

The focus is on practical, well-structured content that connects theory with real-world applications 
in data-driven problem solving.

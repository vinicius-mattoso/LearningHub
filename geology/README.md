## 🌍 01 — Geology & Well Logs — Visualization and Interpretation

Before any petrophysical modeling or machine learning workflow, it is essential to **understand,
inspect and visualize well log data correctly**.

Well logs follow strict visualization conventions developed over decades of professional use.
Reproducing these conventions programmatically is a key step toward reliable analysis and automation.

In this first geology module, we explore:

- The **LAS (Log ASCII Standard)** format and its structure
- Reading and organizing well log data using Python
- Depth-based visualization (depth on the Y-axis, increasing downward)
- Track-style plots used in professional interpretation software
- Filled curves for quick visual assessment (e.g. CALI, GR)
- Overlay plots with multiple X-axes (RHOB + NPHI)
- Visual comparison between physical measurements and **lithofacies labels**
- Practical plotting details that improve interpretability (axis orientation, scaling, colors)
